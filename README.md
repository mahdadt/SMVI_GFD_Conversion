# SMVI_GFD_Conversion
This repository contains Python codes for converting the SMVI Global Flash Droughts Dataset from CSV to NetCDF format. This repository is complimentary to the original Hydroshare repository containing the files. This repository only contains the Jupyter Python code to convert the original CSV files to NetCDF format. For more information on the SMVI Global Flash Droughts Dataset, variable descriptions, and citation information, please refer to the original Hydroshare repository available at: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/b6d1d853b82247e1aeaf907ac254c99e/

# How to use
Put the original CSV files in the Flash Drought and Composite Folders. As can be seen here, the folders are symbolic link folders. You can create the folders and download the original files from Hydroshare. Due to the size limit, it was impossible to include the files here.
